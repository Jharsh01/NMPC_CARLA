// Plant backed by a Project Chrono vehicle: the multibody sedan from Chrono's
// model library on Pacejka (PAC2002) tires.
//
// What Chrono simulates: the chassis in 3D (roll, pitch, heave), double-wishbone
// front and multi-link rear suspension, rack-and-pinion steering, the driveline
// with its differential, the brakes, each wheel's spin, and the four tires with
// their own loads, so load transfers left to right as well as front to rear.
//
// What this class adds to fit the project's interface:
// - input: the steering rate is integrated to a road-wheel angle, passed through
//   a first-order actuator lag and converted to Chrono's steering input; a
//   positive Fx becomes a torque on the driven (front) axle shafts and a negative
//   one a brake command. Chrono's engine and gearbox are left out: the drive
//   force is delivered as asked, within the limits in the vehicle parameters.
// - state: [X, Y, psi, Ux, Uy, r, delta] is read at the vehicle's centre of
//   mass; delta is the commanded road-wheel angle after the actuator, as a
//   steering-column sensor would report it. The wheels' true angle differs a
//   little under load (suspension compliance, roll steer).
// - friction: the ground is flat with one friction coefficient, set per step.
//   Chrono scales the tire's own peak friction by mu / 0.8.
//
// reset() places the car at X, Y, psi with speed Ux; Uy, r and delta start at 0.
